# VGA Black Hole Visualizer (TinyTapeout)

A fully hardware-rendered VGA demoscene that visualizes a stylized black hole inspired by *Interstellar’s Gargantua*, built for TinyTapeout using only integer arithmetic, fixed-function geometry, and handcrafted pixel logic.

This design renders in real time at 640×480@60 Hz, producing:
- A circular event-horizon shadow  
- A vertically compressed accretion disk with flowing plasma rings  
- A surrounding halo of lensed light  
- An animated falling **“UW”** logo that respects occlusion  

The entire scene fits comfortably within a single TinyTapeout tile.
